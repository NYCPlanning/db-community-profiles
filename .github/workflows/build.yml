          ## 🎉 There is updated Community Profiles data from ${{steps.build.outputs.date}}
          ## Next Steps: 
          If you have manually checked above files and they seem to be ok, comment `[publish]` under this issue. 
          This would allow github actions to publish files to DigitalOcean, where Labs will pull files for download. 
          Feel free to close this issue once it's all complete. Thanks!
